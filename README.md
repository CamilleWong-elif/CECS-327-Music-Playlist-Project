## Summary of Changes Made by Helen & Ren
### Port Notes: 
- We changed the port from 5000 to 5001 for client and server since that port was already taken on our local machine and we couldn't fully kill it. 
- Feel free to change it back to port 5000 though!  
  
### Server.py
- Edited server.py so we can work on notifications.py
